# README: Comprehensive Overview of Speech Detection, Medical SOAP Classification, and Model Training

---

## Overview

This project integrates workflows for **speech detection**, **medical SOAP classification**, and **machine learning model training** into a cohesive pipeline. It leverages cutting-edge tools such as OpenAI Whisper, Hugging Face Transformers, and Named Entity Recognition models to process, analyze, and generate insights from speech, text, and structured datasets.

## Key Objectives

1. **Speech Detection and Processing**:
   - Preprocess audio files through denoising, segmentation, and transcription.
   - Use the OpenAI Whisper model for accurate speech-to-text conversions.
   - Organize outputs into structured directories.

2. **Medical SOAP Classification**:
   - Analyze medical dialogues to classify text into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan categories.
   - Employ NLP and entity recognition models to extract structured medical information.
   - Save categorized data for downstream analysis.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Fine-tune pre-trained models for specific NLP tasks such as summarization or translation.
   - Configure and evaluate models using advanced metrics like F1 score and BLEU score.
   - Save and reuse trained models for scalable applications.

## Highlights of the Workflow

1. **Audio Preprocessing**:
   - Convert audio formats for compatibility and remove irrelevant content.
   - Segment long audio files into manageable chunks.

2. **Speech-to-Text and Transcription**:
   - Generate high-quality transcriptions from audio data.
   - Clean and refine text outputs to remove placeholders and noise markers.

3. **SOAP Categorization**:
   - Map medical entities to SOAP components for actionable insights.
   - Aggregate data into CSV files for easy retrieval.

4. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Train transformer models on custom datasets.
   - Evaluate performance using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.

5. **Evaluation and Organization**:
   - Measure transcription quality with Word Error Rate (WER) and BLEU scores.
   - Organize data outputs into structured folders for scalable use.
